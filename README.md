A brief description of your project goes here.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required for the project:

- `plyr`
- `colorama`
- `plyer`
- `schedule`

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project and install the necessary dependencies:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

- **For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- **For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This will create a `venv` folder in your project directory.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **For Windows:**

```bash
.env\Scriptsctivate
```

- **For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install plyr colorama plyer schedule
```

### 4. Run the Project

You can now run the project by executing the main Python file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Notes

- Make sure you activate the virtual environment each time you work on the project.
- If you need to deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```
